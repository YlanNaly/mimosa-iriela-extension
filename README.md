# ðŸ”Ž Overview
A normative extension of the agent-based modeling platform MIMOSA. This extension aims at agents to be able to represent and reason about regulativeNorms. We categorize regulativeNorms in 3 types : obligations, prohibitions, and permission according to Ostrom &amp; Crawford. 

The end-goal is to write a planning problem, with a set of institutions and organizations which endows regulativeNorms to its members, and see how they affect the agent's behavior. 

# âš™ Tools

This extension requires the following tools : 

`Java 11 or higher`

`Maven`

`Lombok`

`JUnit 5`

# ðŸ–‹ Theoric background

The tool is based upon the Partial-Order Planner (POP), which refines a plan until it becomes executable. In addition to the standard types of flaws, we propose three other types of flaws relative to regulativeNorms, and their resolvers.

`Missing obligation`

`Missing prohibition` 

`Missing permission`

# ðŸ§ª Test model

To illustrate the type of problem this tool can solve, we propose a toy model on a single agent, whose goal is to feed his family. Its possible actions are defined by the organizations it is a part of : 
- hunt
- harvest
- cut 
- move
